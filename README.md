# Golf Mk4 Remote Start
This remote start is made and tested for an Golf MK4, but will probarbly work on most older cars as long as the immobilizer is removed/defeated.
You will need to have an neutral switch if its an manual car, you can easily add this into the arduino. 
You need an SIM card that you can send SMS messages to, i've just used an prepaid card, since it does not cost anything to send SMS to them.
